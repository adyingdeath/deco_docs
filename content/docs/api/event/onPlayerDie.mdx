title: onPlayerDie

This is a function decorator.

The decorated function will be called when a player dies for any reason.

## Parameters

This decorator doesn't take any parameters.

- The `@s` is the player who died.
- The `execution position` is the position of the player at the time of death.

## Example

```
@onPlayerDie
func onPlayerDie {
    tellraw @a [{"selector":"@s"},{"text":" has died. Rest in peace."}]
}
```

You can use this to create custom death messages or effects:

```
@onPlayerDie
func onPlayerDie {
    # Create a lightning strike at the death location
    summon lightning_bolt ~ ~ ~
    
    # Send a custom message to all players
    tellraw @a [{"selector":"@s","color":"red"},{"text":" has fallen in battle!","color":"gold"}]
}
```
