This is a function decorator.

The decorated function will be called when a player right-clicks with a carrot on a stick.

## Parameters

This decorator doesn't take any parameters.

- The `@s` is the player who right-clicked with the carrot on a stick.
- The `execution position` is the position of the player.

## Example

```
@carrotOnAStick
func onCarrot {
    tellraw @s [{"selector":"@s"},{"text":" right-clicked with a carrot on a stick."}]
}
```

Use with `raycast`(see [raycast](/docs/api/function/raycast)) to perform actions at the location the player is looking at:

```
@carrotOnAStick
func onCarrot {
    say Someone just right-clicked with a carrot on a stick.
    raycast("@s", "minecraft:sand", 0.01, 100, "summon minecraft:tnt ~ ~ ~")
}
```

Summon a TNT at the location the player is looking at when they right-click with a carrot on a stick.
