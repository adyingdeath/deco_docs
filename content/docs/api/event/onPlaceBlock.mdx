title: onPlaceBlock
---

This is a function decorator.

The decorated function will be called when a player places a block.

## Parameters

import { TypeTable } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/type-table';
 
<TypeTable
  type={{
    block: {
      description: "The block you want to detect.",
      type: "String",
      default: "-",
    },
  }}
/>

- The `@s` is the player who placed the block.
- The `execution position` is **NOT** the position of the block that the player placed, but the position of the player.

## Example

```
@onPlaceBlock("minecraft:stone")
func onPlaceBlock {
    tellraw @s [{"selector":"@s"},{"text":" placed a stone block."}]
}
```

Use with `raycast`(see [raycast](/docs/api/function/raycast)) to detect the block that the player just placed. (It's not promised to be the exact block that the player placed)

```
@onPlaceBlock("minecraft:stone")
func onPlaceBlock {
    raycast("@s", "minecraft:stone", 0.01, 10, "setblock ~ ~ ~ gold_block")
}
```
