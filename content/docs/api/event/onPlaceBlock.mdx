This is a function decorator.

The decorated function will be called when a player places a block.

## Parameters

import {
  Table,
  TableBody,
  TableCell,
  TableHead,
  TableHeader,
  TableRow,
} from "@/components/ui/table"

<Table>
  <TableHeader>
    <TableRow>
      <TableHead>Parameter</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Description</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Type</TableHead>
      <TableHead>Default</TableHead>
    </TableRow>
  </TableHeader>
  <TableBody>
    <TableRow>
      <TableCell>block</TableCell>
      <TableCell>The block you want to detect.</TableCell>
      <TableCell>String</TableCell>
      <TableCell>-</TableCell>
    </TableRow>
  </TableBody>
</Table>

- The `@s` is the player who placed the block.
- The `execution position` is **NOT** the position of the block that the player placed, but the position of the player. It's because currently we haven't figured out stable way to get the position of the block that the player placed.

## Example

```
@onPlaceBlock("minecraft:stone")
func onPlaceBlock {
    tellraw @s [{"selector":"@s"},{"text":" placed a stone block."}]
}
```

Use with `raycast`(see [raycast](/docs/api/function/raycast)) to detect the block that the player just placed. (It's not promised to be the exact block that the player placed)

```
@onPlaceBlock("minecraft:stone")
func onPlaceBlock {
    raycast("@s", "minecraft:stone", 0.01, 10, "setblock ~ ~ ~ gold_block")
}
```
