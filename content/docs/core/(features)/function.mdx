title: Function
---

You can use keyword `func` to define a function in `.deco` file.

## Function Definition

The function you define in `.deco` file will be saved as a `.mcfunction` file in the same folder of your `.deco` file.

For example, if you have a `.deco` file in `functions/core/test.deco` and the content of the file is:

```
func helloworld {
    say Hello, world!
}
```

After compiling, Deco will generate a `helloworld.mcfunction` file in the same folder of your `test.deco` file: `functions/core/helloworld.mcfunction`.

**Note:** Since Minecraft only supports lowercase function names, Deco will convert the function name to lowercase. You can still use uppercase function names in your `.deco` file for better readability, but remember it will be converted to lowercase after compiling.

## Implicit Functions

Since Deco is designed to be compatible with vanilla datapack, codes that are directly written in `.deco` file without `func` keyword will still be treated as a deco function as well.

For example, if you have a `.deco` file in `functions/core/test.deco` and the content of the file is:

```
say Hello, world!
```

After compiling, Deco will generate a `test.mcfunction` file in the same folder of your `test.deco` file: `functions/core/test.mcfunction`, containing the code you wrote:

```
say Hello, world!
```

If there are mixed codes in your `.deco` file, Deco will treat them as implicit functions.

## Mixed Functions

If your `.deco` file contains both directly written code and code wrapped in `func` blocks, Deco will generate multiple `.mcfunction` files. The code outside of any `func` blocks will be compiled into a `.mcfunction` file named after the `.deco` file, while each `func` block will generate its own `.mcfunction` file named after the function.

For example, if you have a `.deco` file in `functions/core/test.deco` with the following content:

```
say This is outside of any function

func helloworld {
    say Hello, world!
}

func goodbye {
    say Goodbye!
}

say This is another command
```

After compiling, Deco will generate three `.mcfunction` files:

```
functions/
└── core/
    ├── test.mcfunction
    ├── helloworld.mcfunction
    └── goodbye.mcfunction
```

Each file will contain the code from the corresponding section of the `.deco` file:

import { Tab, Tabs } from 'fumadocs-ui/components/tabs';
 
<Tabs items={['test.mcfunction', 'helloworld.mcfunction', 'goodbye.mcfunction']}>
  <Tab value="test.mcfunction">
    ```
    say This is outside of any function
    say This is another command
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="helloworld.mcfunction">
    ```
    say Hello, world!
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="goodbye.mcfunction">
    ```
    say Goodbye!
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>
