title: Decorator
---

Decorators in Deco are special annotations that provide additional functionality to functions. They are marked with the `@` symbol and placed before function definitions. Decorators allow you to bind functions to specific Minecraft events or tags, simplifying datapack development.

## Using Decorators

The basic syntax for a decorator is:

```
@decoratorName(arguments)
func functionName {
    // function code
}
```

Where:
- `@decoratorName`: The name of the decorator, starting with `@`
- `(arguments)`: Optional parameters, some decorators require arguments
- `func functionName { ... }`: The decorated function

For example, the following code uses the `@load` decorator to mark a function that will execute when the datapack is loaded:

```
@load
func initialize {
    tellraw @a {"text":"Datapack loaded!","color":"green"}
}
```

### Multiple Decorators

A single function can have multiple decorators applied to it by listing them before the function definition:

```
@load
@tag("custom:init")
func setupGame {
    scoreboard objectives add health health
    scoreboard objectives setdisplay sidebar health
}
```

This function will run both when the datapack is loaded and when you run `function #custom:init`.

### Decorator Arguments

Some decorators need arguments to specify their behavior. Arguments are provided in parentheses after the decorator name:

```
@tag("minecraft:load")
func onLoad {
    say Datapack loaded!
}
```

```
@onPlaceBlock("minecraft:redstone_block")
func powerOn {
    say Power activated!
}
```

## How Decorators Work

During compilation, Deco automatically generates the necessary function tag files and event handling code based on the decorators:

- `@load` and `@tick` decorators add your functions to Minecraft's built-in `minecraft:load` and `minecraft:tick` tags
- `@tag` adds your function to the specified custom tag
- `@onPlaceBlock` creates an advanced detection system using advancements and functions to detect when specific blocks are placed
- ...

This automatic generation saves you from having to manually create these structures, making your datapack development more efficient and your code more readable.

## Available Decorators

Deco currently supports the following decorators:

### @load

The `@load` decorator registers a function to run when the datapack is loaded.

```
@load
func initialize {
    tellraw @a {"text":"Datapack loaded!","color":"green"}
    scoreboard objectives add myScore dummy
}
```

After compilation, this function will be automatically added to the `minecraft:load` function tag, causing it to run whenever the datapack is loaded.

### @tick

The `@tick` decorator registers a function to run every game tick.

```
@tick
func update {
    execute as @a at @s run particle minecraft:end_rod ~ ~1 ~ 0.2 0.2 0.2 0 1
}
```

After compilation, this function will be automatically added to the `minecraft:tick` function tag, causing it to run every game tick.

### @tag

The `@tag` decorator allows you to add a function to a specific function tag.

```
@tag("custom:example")
func myTaggedFunction {
    say This function is in a custom tag!
}
```

After compilation, this function will be added to the specified function tag, in this case `custom:example`.

### @onPlaceBlock

The `@onPlaceBlock` decorator binds a function to the event of a player placing a specific block.

```
@onPlaceBlock("minecraft:diamond_block")
func onDiamondPlaced {
    tellraw @a [{"selector":"@s"},{"text":" placed a diamond block!"}]
    give @s minecraft:diamond 1
}
```

When a player places a diamond block, the function will be triggered, displaying a message to all players and giving a diamond to the player who placed the block.
