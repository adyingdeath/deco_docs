## Create a Project

What is special about Deco is that it uses exactly the same folder structure as vanilla Minecraft datapacks.

So, you can just copy any of your existing datapacks and use Deco on them. Or create a new one if you want to.

Now, we got a folder structure like this:

```
<datapack>/
├── pack.mcmeta
└── data/
    └── <namespace>/
        └── functions/
            ├── <filename>.mcfunction
            └── <filename>.deco
```

`.mcfunction` files are still valid in Deco, so if you have a `.mcfunction` in your datapack and don't want to use any Deco features in it, you can just leave it as is.

Then, create a `.deco` file in the `functions` folder and start your Deco journey!

## First Deco File

Let's create a simple Deco file called `gold_touch.deco` and put it in the `functions` folder:

```
gold_touch_src/
└── data/
    └── <namespace>/
        └── functions/
            └── gold_touch.deco
```

Now, let's write some Deco code in the `gold_touch.deco` file:

```
@onPlaceBlock("minecraft:stone")
func gold_touch() {
    tellraw @s [{"selector":"@s"},{"text":", it is your gold touch!"}]
    raycast("@s", "minecraft:stone", 0.01, 10, "setblock ~ ~ ~ gold_block")
}
```

The function of this Deco file is:

1. When a player places a stone block, the player will be notified that they have the gold touch.
2. Then, the stone block will be replaced with a gold block, by using the `raycast` command.

## Compile

Let's compile the Deco project. Change the directory to the folder where you put the `gold_touch_src` folder and run the following command:

```
deco -o gold_touch gold_touch_src
```

This will compile the Deco project(`gold_touch_src`) and create a `gold_touch` folder in the current directory. You can see some `.mcfunction` files and advancements files in the `gold_touch` folder, which are the compiled result of the `gold_touch_src` project.

Now, you can use the `gold_touch` datapack in your game. Just put the `gold_touch` folder in your `datapacks` folder and experiment with it!
