## Create a Project

What is special about Deco is that it uses exactly the same folder structure as vanilla Minecraft datapacks.

So, you can just copy any of your existing datapacks and use Deco on them. Or create a new one if you want to.

Now, we got a folder structure like this:

```
<datapack>/
├── pack.mcmeta
└── data/
    └── <namespace>/
        └── functions/
            ├── <filename>.mcfunction
            └── <filename>.deco
```

`.mcfunction` files are still valid in Deco, so if you have a `.mcfunction` in your datapack and don't want to use any Deco features in it, you can just leave it as is.

Then, create a `.deco` file in the `functions` folder and start DECOrating!
