<Accordion title="How to install Java?">
If you don't have Java installed, you can download it from [here](https://jdk.java.net/archive/). Find the version you need and download it. I recommend using `17.0.2`.

It's a zip file, so you need to unzip it. Then, add the `bin` folder to your PATH.

If you don't know how to do it, you can ask Google or AI.
