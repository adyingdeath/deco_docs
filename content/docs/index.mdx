Deco is a newly designed language specifically for helping you create Minecraft datapacks faster and easier. It follows a progressive design philosophy, meaning that original Minecraft datapacks and mcfunction files are valid Deco code, allowing you to gradually incorporate Deco syntax to leverage its power.

## Key Features

- Fully compatible with vanilla datapacks
- Support for tick, load, and function tags
- Quick and easy event binding, like `@onPlaceBlock`, `@onPlayerDie`, etc
- Clean syntax for improved development efficiency
